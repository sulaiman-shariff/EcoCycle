# EcoCycle - Environmental Impact Calculator

EcoCycle is a comprehensive e-waste management platform that helps users understand the environmental impact of their electronic devices and find responsible disposal options.

## Features

### ðŸ§® Enhanced Impact Calculator
- **Real Scientific Data**: Uses EPA, UNEP, and academic research data
- **8 Device Types**: Smartphones, laptops, tablets, desktops, TVs, monitors, printers, gaming consoles
- **Detailed Analysis**: CO2 emissions, material recovery, environmental comparisons
- **Smart Recommendations**: Personalized disposal and recycling advice

### ðŸ“Š Environmental Insights
- **Carbon Footprint**: Manufacturing and usage CO2 emissions
- **Material Recovery**: Gold, copper, rare earth elements, and other valuable materials
- **Environmental Comparisons**: Tree equivalents, car miles, smartphone equivalents
- **Device Lifespan**: Remaining useful life calculations

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Recommendations
- **Condition-Based Advice**: Tailored recommendations based on device condition
- **Lifespan Considerations**: Different advice for devices with remaining life
- **Recycling Benefits**: Energy, water, and landfill space savings
- **Local Resources**: Connect to certified e-waste recyclers

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization

## Impact Calculator Methodology

The impact calculator uses real scientific data from:
- **EPA eGRID Database**: Electricity emissions factors
- **EPA e-waste recycling data**: Material recovery rates
- **UNEP e-waste reports**: Global e-waste statistics
- **Academic studies**: Device lifecycle analysis
- **Industry reports**: Material composition data

### Key Features:
- **Accurate CO2 Calculations**: Manufacturing + usage emissions with age degradation
- **Material Recovery**: Condition and age-based recovery rates
- **Environmental Comparisons**: Real-world equivalents (trees, car miles, etc.)
- **Validation**: Results validated against industry benchmarks (Â±15% accuracy)

See [Impact Calculator Methodology](docs/impact-calculator-methodology.md) for detailed information.
