# Impact Calculator Methodology

## Overview

The EcoCycle Impact Calculator uses real scientific data to estimate the environmental impact of electronic devices. This document outlines the data sources, calculation methods, and assumptions used in the calculator.

## Data Sources

### CO2 Emissions Data
- **Manufacturing CO2**: Based on EPA eGRID data and academic studies on electronic device manufacturing
- **Usage CO2**: Calculated using device energy consumption and regional electricity grid emissions factors
- **Age Degradation**: Accounts for increased energy consumption as devices age

### Material Recovery Data
- **Gold Content**: Based on EPA e-waste analysis and industry reports
- **Copper Content**: Derived from device weight and typical material composition
- **Rare Earth Elements**: Based on UNEP e-waste reports and academic studies
- **Other Materials**: Aluminum, plastic, and glass content from device teardown analyses

### Device Specifications
- **Weight**: Actual device specifications from manufacturer data
- **Lifespan**: Based on industry averages and consumer behavior studies
- **Energy Consumption**: EPA Energy Star data and academic research

## Calculation Methodology

### CO2 Emissions Calculation

```
Total CO2 = Manufacturing CO2 + (Usage CO2 × Age Multiplier)
```

Where:
- **Manufacturing CO2**: Fixed value based on device type
- **Usage CO2**: Annual energy consumption × electricity emissions factor × device age
- **Age Multiplier**: Accounts for decreased efficiency over time

### Material Recovery Calculation

```
Recoverable Material = Base Material Content × Condition Multiplier × Age Multiplier
```

Where:
- **Condition Multiplier**: 
  - Good: 90% recovery
  - Fair: 70% recovery  
  - Poor: 40% recovery
- **Age Multiplier**: Decreases with device age due to material degradation

### Environmental Comparisons
